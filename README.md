# A Multimodal Investigation of Histomorphological and Molecular Features of Normal Breast Tissue to Explore Ageing-Related Changes in Germline BRCA1/2 Individuals

Code used in my MRes Translational Cancer Medicine lab rotation project 1, which focused on identifying ageing-related histo gBRCA1/2 gene expression changes in normal breast fibroblasts. This repository contains scripts different parts of my project, including: differential expression (DE) analysis of fibroblasts using publicly available datasets on normal breast tissue.
