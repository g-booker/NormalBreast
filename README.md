# NormalBreast
Code from my MRes Translational Cancer Medicine lab rotation project. This repository contains scripts for differential expression (DE) analysis using publicly available datasets on normal breast tissue. The project focuses on identifying age-related and gBRCA1/2 gene expression changes in normal breast fibroblasts.
